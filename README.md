## Analyzing a Bike shop's data and proposing Analytical Business Solutions

### Introduction üìã

In this project, we are using a bike shop dataset from Kaggle that contains 6 years of data. The main objectives are to clean the data, perform exploratory analysis to understand the business and uncover key insights, and then propose analytical business solutions, including two interactive dashboards and one custom app. This will help the bike shop make better-informed decisions and improve overall business performance.

#### Problem Statement

The bike shop is unsure how to utilize the data collected over the past few years and seeks a way to easily access and understand it.

#### Deliverables

- **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover key insights from the data.
- **Create Two Interactive Dashboards:** Provide real-time data visualization.
- **Develop a Custom App:** Facilitate ongoing data monitoring and decision support.

#### Goal

Act as business analyst consultants to analyze the data and propose solutions for better business understanding and data-driven decision-making. The aim is to enhance the bike shop's ability to make informed decisions and improve overall business performance.
